\section{Semantic Web}
The semantic web is a set of standards defined by the World Wide Web Consortium\cite{w3c_website} with the goal of allowing computers to parse and understand internet data. The primary technologies they developed for this are the Resource Description Framework\cite{w3c_rdf} (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language\cite{w3c_owl} (OWL).

\subsection{RDF}
The Resource Description Framework is designed to standardise links between subjects and objects, and while it was initially designed for metadata, it is now used generally across a wide variety of domains. At its core are RDF graphs, sets of \texttt{(subject, predicate, object)} triples. \texttt{subject}s and \texttt{object}s are called resources (typically either text or IRIs\cite{iri_rfc}) and denote something that exists, while \texttt{predicates} denote properties and are always IRIs. These depict a relationship between the \texttt{subject} and the \texttt{object}, with \texttt{predicate} indicating the type of relationship. This can be depicted as a directed graph, with \texttt{subject}s and \texttt{object}s being vertices, and \texttt{predicate}s being edge labels. For example the RDF graph \{\texttt{(sky, colour, blue), (sky, above, grass), (sky, above, trees), (grass, colour, green), (trees, colour, green)}\} could be depicted as below.

\subsection{OWL}
The Web Ontology Language (OWL) and its successor (OWL2) are designed to be consistent frameworks to describe a variety of concepts related to the internet. It does this by providing a set of axioms which constrain types of items (called ``classes'') and what relationships are permitted between them. This makes it possible to reason with data created by someone else because they will all use the same terms. OWL generally uses RDF (or a similar format) for describing the actual layout of the data, instead concerning itself with what sort of constraints those relationships model.

There are multiple different types of both OWL and OWL2, designed for different use cases. OWL2 has a general specification \emph{OWL2 DL}\cite{w3c_owl2} and then there exist profiles which remove some of the complexity to make them easier to use for particular domains, while still remaining fully compatible with \emph{DL}. These profiles are \emph{OWL2 EL}, designed for relatively simple reasoning over very large datasets, \emph{OWL2 QL} which allows queries about relationships between items to be answered very efficiently, for example in databases, and \emph{OWL2 RL} which allows the user to reason directly on RDF triples.

\section{Methods}

\subsection*{Notation}

Let $A = (V_A,E_A, \varepsilon_A)$ and $B = (V_B,E_B, \varepsilon_B)$ be two graphs with respective adjacency matrices $\mathbf A_A$ and $\mathbf A_B$.

Let $n_A = |E_A|$, $n_B = |E_B|$ and $m_A = |V_A|$, $m_B = |V_B|$

\subsection{Similarity}
Each vertex has a unique id (a unique name). Two vertices of different graphs {\it match} when they have the same id.
We say that the edges $e_A \in E_A$ and $e_B \in E_B$ are {\it matching} if $\varepsilon_A(e_A)$ and $\varepsilon_B(e_B)$ map to matching vertices.

According to \cite{2019osti}, the {\it similarity} between two networks is the mean of four measurements:
\paragraph{Edge strength similarity $L_S$}
\[L_S = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n|S_i^A - S_i^B|}{\sum_{i=1}^n|S_i^A + S_i^B|},\]
where $S_i^A$ and $S_i^B$ are the strength (or weights) of the edge $i$ in both graphs.

\paragraph{Matching edge ratio $L_M$}
\[L_M = \frac{N_E}{n},\]
where $N_E$ is the number of edges matching in both networks, and $n$ is the total number of edges, $n = \max(n_A,n_B) = \max(|E_A|, |E_B|)$.

\paragraph{Vertex ratio $V_M$}
\[V_M = \frac{N_V}{m},\]
where $N_E$ is the number of matching vertices between networks, and $m$ is the total number of vertices, $m = \max(m_A,m_B)=  \max(|V_A|, |V_B|)$.

\paragraph{Matching Cluster Ratio $V_C$}
\[V_C = \frac{N_C}{m},\]
where $N_C$ is the number of vertex clusters shared between the graphs and $m$ is the number of vertices, as above.

According to \cite{2019osti}, the {\bf total similarity} is

$$S = \dfrac{(1-L_S) + L_M + V_M + V_C}{4},\qquad S \in [0,1]$$

Note that the studied and produced graphs of this paper do not use weighted edges. Thus, to compute the total similarity we do not take into account the {\bf edge strength similarity},
i.e.
$$S = \dfrac{L_M + V_M + V_C}{3},\qquad S \in [0,1]$$

Two identical graphs will have a total similarity of one, so the further it is from that (and the closer to zero) the less similar the graphs are.

\subsection{Connectivity and communities}

The {\it vertex connectivity} $\kappa(A)$ of a connected graph $A$ refers to the least cardinality $\kappa(A) = |S|$ of a subset of the vertex set $S \subset V_A$ such that the new graph $\tilde A = (\tilde V_A, \tilde E_A, \tilde \varepsilon_A)$ (with $\tilde V_A = V_A \backslash S$) is either disconnected or trivial.
Such set $S$ is called a {\it minimum vertex cut}.

The {\it strong vertices} are the vertices with a maximum vertex connectivity.
%
\vspace{-.5cm} %otherwise it is a bit "too" far away
%
\paragraph{Computation of the connectivity of a graph}
Let $N(v_1)$ be the set of all adjacent vertices to $v_1$ (note that if $v_2\in N(v_1)$, then we have $v_1 \in N(v_2)$).\\
Then, for an arbitrary vertex $v_1$:
%
\begin{align*}
\shortintertext{If $\exists S$ s.t. $v_1 \not\in S$, i.e. there is a minimum vertex-cut that does not contain $v_1$ then}
  \kappa(A) &= \min\big\{\kappa(v_1,v_2) \:|\: v_1 \in V_A,\: v_2 \in V_A\backslash\{v_1\},\: \text{and $v_2$ is not adjacent to $v_1$}\big\}\\\\
\shortintertext{If $v_1 \in S,\: \forall S$ then}
  \kappa(A) &= \min\big\{\kappa(v_2,v_3) \:|\: v_2,v_3 \in N(v_1),\:\text{and $v_2,v_1$ are not adjacent}\big\}
\end{align*}

We can compute the connectivity by the maximum flow algorithm proposed by A.H. Esfahanian \cite[Algorithm 11]{2013Esfahanian}.

% talk about Menger's theorem (?)

The aim of computing the connectivity of a graph is to compare the strong vertices of different graphs. There are two questions to ask:
Do both graphs have the same strong vertex? If they do, how different is their connectivity?\\
If the difference between the connectivity of the strong vertex of each graph is close to zero, both graphs will be considered to have a similar structure.

In this paper we will focus on the communities, they are closely related to the strong vertices since two communities are separated by a strong vertex. They will be computed with the \texttt{Mathematica} function \texttt{FindGraphCommunities}.

\subsection{Spectral distances}

Following \cite{2020Wills}, the $i,j-$th component of an {\it adjacency matrix} is defined as
$$\mathbf A_{i,j} = \begin{cases}1&\text{if}\; i\sim j,\\0&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$
The fact that $A_{i,j} = \{0,1\}$ means that there is at most one edge between two vertices. Thereby we can define the {\it degree} $d_i$ of the vertex $i$ as the number of edges connected to the $i$.

The {\it degree matrix} $\mathbf D$ is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal contains the degree of each vertex.

$$\mathbf D_{i,j} =  \begin{cases}d_i&\text{if}\; i = j,\\0&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$

\paragraph{Spectrum of a matrix}

The {\it spectrum of a matrix} is a sorted sequence of eigenvalues.\\
Let us denote the $i$-th eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix by $\lambda_i^{\mathbf A}$, and the $i$-th eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix by $\lambda_i^{\mathbf L}$

\paragraph{Adjacency and Laplacian spectral distance} \label{sec:spectral_distance}
Let $\lambda^{\mathbf A_A}$ and  $\lambda^{\mathbf A_B}$ be the adjacency spectra of the graphs $A$ and $B$ and let $\lambda^{\mathbf L_A}$ and  $\lambda^{\mathbf L_B}$ be their Laplacian spectra.

Then, the {\bf Adjacency spectral distance} is defined as

$$d_{\mathbf A}(A,B) = \Bigg( \sum_{i=1}^n (\lambda_i^{\mathbf A_A} - \lambda_i^{\mathbf A_B})^2\Bigg)^{1/2}$$

The {\bf Laplacian spectral distance} is defined equivalently, but obviously using the Laplacian spectra.

In this paper, the Adjacency and Laplacian spectral distances will be computed as defined in the \texttt{Week8-ComparingGraphs2023-4} worksheet.

\section{Graph Generation} \label{sec:graph_gen}
To generate our RDF graph we chose to automatically link the maths modules to msc2020\cite{msc_2010} codes. This allowed both a greater degree of objectivity and for us to include all modules on our graph rather than only those we have taken. Notice that each module descriptor has a similar style (except Group Project which we didn't classify as it is too varied). Thereby we were able to parse their PDF descriptors and only take the ``Syllabus Plan''.

The syllabus plan is then split into words which are classified according to the msc2020 code using Mathematica's built-in classifier trained on the entire subject classification (imported as a csv). One of problems we encountered was the use of pronouns and prepositions (`a', `the', `as', `and', `also', etc) as well as `general' maths vocabulary (`mathematics', `model', `theorem', etc). As these words were used in several if not all syllabus plans, they shouldn't be classified. To resolve this problem generally (rather than needing to create a list of ignored words) we used the probability that Mathematica assigns to its classifications. For each module we then summed up the probabilities for any repeated codes and ordered them in a decreasing order.

Let us consider the first 6 words of MTH1000 (Foundations) as an example :

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] We have the following list : 
\{\texttt{Functions, logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric, hyperbolic, Partial}\}
\item[2.] Then we use \texttt{Classifier} to convert the initial list into a list of tuples containing the msc2020 code assigned to the word and its probability : 
\{\texttt{\{26Axx, 0.423802\}, \{11Axx, 0.760049\}, \{34Axx, 0.282966\}, \{42Axx, 0.968698\}, \{35Axx, 0.994287\}, \{35Axx, 0.342177\}}\}
\item[3.] If the tuples have the same msc code (first entry) they are grouped together and their probability (second entry) is summed up. In this case only the \texttt{35Axx} elements are combined, resulting in the list: \{\texttt{\{35Axx, 1.336464\}, \{42Axx, 0.968698\}, \{11Axx, 0.760049\}, \{26Axx, 0.423802\}, \{34Axx, 0.282966\}}\}
	\item[4.] We then normalise these values so that they sum to $1$, ensuring consistency across module descriptors of different lengths: \{\texttt{\{35Axx, 0.354314\}, \{42Axx, 0.256814\}, \{11Axx, 0.201499\}, \{26Axx, 0.112355\}, \{34Axx, 0.0750179\}}\}
   	\item[5.] Finally, we connect the module code to the msc code if its probability is greater than $0.05$. In this example, all words are connected, but in general this averages out to about $5$ connections per module, although it varies between $2$ and $8$. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Loading other graphs}
In order to compare our graph to the ones generated manually, we import and merge all 5 of the public graphs shared to the forum (thanks to Ben White, Holly Barber, Lucie Johnson, Luke Garner and Donovan Tran). While these all do roughly follow our shared ontology (notably the relationship we want is always marked as \texttt{ex[uses]}), they use different urls to refer to MSC codes so can't directly be combined. Most of these graphs also link to the fine-grained codes like \texttt{03D65} however there wasn't enough text in these to classify so we instead only link to the more general \texttt{03Axx} codes. Therefore to combine these graphs we first filter them to remove all non-\texttt{ex[used]} relations and use regex to convert all msc codes to a shared format.

The advantage of combining these graphs rather than comparing against any single one of them is that each graph only contains those modules the author has taken and so by combining them we get a more well-rounded view of the modules as a whole. Despite this there are still some modules none of these graphs classify such as \texttt{MTH1000}, and so we removed these nodes from our graph for most comparisons.

\section{Comparison}
When discussing generating graphs (section \ref{sec:graph_gen}) we picked an arbitrary probability cutoff of $0.05$ to define whether a particular edge is included in our final graph. Using the Adjacency and Laplacian spectral distances (section \ref{sec:spectral_distance}) we can instead compare a variety of different cutoffs and graph them, showing whether our picked value is reasonable.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{CutoffComparison.pdf}
\caption{Variation of the Laplacian and Adjacency coefficients as a function of the cutoff value}
\label{fig:cutoff_comp}
\end{figure}

As we can see from Fig.\ref{fig:cutoff_comp}, our probability value of $0.05$ is very close to the theoretical ``best'' value which -- based on this test data -- would be between $0.045$ and $0.049$. Notice also that this graph is overall monotonically increasing away from the centre. {\color{red}REFORMULER : This means that most of the new data we are adding is useful to the score (for the line to the right), and most of the data we are removing was useful for the line to the left, as opposed to it being more of a mixed bag which would suggest that our scoring mechanism was not suited to the task.}

Let {\bf RDF ours} denote our graph and {\bf RDF other} denote the graph generated by loading the public graphs shared in the forum. We compute their respective communities using mathematica's built in function \texttt{FindGraphCommunities} and obtain the graphs displayed in Fig.\ref{fig:communities_comp}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[height=\textwidth]{CommunitiesRDFours.pdf}
        \caption{RDF ours (see \ref{app:our_graph_communities})}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[height=\textwidth]{CommunitiesRDFother.pdf}
        \caption{RDF other (see \ref{app:other_graph_communities})}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Communities comparation}
    \label{fig:communities_comp}
\end{figure}


First, notice that both graphs do not have the same number of communities. In fact, {\bf RDF ours} is divided into 8 communities \ref{app:our_graph_communities} whereas {\bf RDF other} has 7 communities \ref{app:other_graph_communities} which are not all connected. By taking a look in \ref{app:communities_comp} we note that {\bf RDF ours}'s communities have vertices correspond to more varied mathematical content. On the other hand, {\bf RDF other} has communities corresponding more to a specific topic in mathematics (e.g. Algebraic strucures, commutative algebra and Number theory (purple), Differential Geometry and applications (Green), etc).   

We use the built-in mathematica function \texttt{KCoreComponents} to compute the groups of vertices that are strongly connected \ref{app:strongly_connected_vertices}. The common strong vertices are MTH1001, MTH1002, MTH1003, MTH2003, MTH2006, MTH2009, MTH3022, MTH3024, 34-ODEs, 40-Sequences, series, summability, 41-Approximations and expansions; these vertices relate to calculus and analytical methods (e.g. Differential equations) and mathematical modeling.
