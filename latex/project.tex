\section{Semantic Web}
The semantic web is a set of standards defined by the World Wide Web Consortium\cite{w3c_website} with the goal of allowing computers to parse and understand internet data. The primary technologies they developed for this are the Resource Description Framework\cite{w3c_rdf} (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language\cite{w3c_owl} (OWL).

\subsection{RDF}
The Resource Description Framework is designed to standardise links between subjects and objects, and while it was initially designed for metadata, it is now used generally across a wide variety of domains. At its core are RDF graphs, sets of \texttt{(subject, predicate, object)} triples. \texttt{subject}s and \texttt{object}s are called resources (typically either text or IRIs\cite{iri_rfc}) and denote something that exists, while \texttt{predicates} denote properties and are always IRIs. These depict a relationship between the \texttt{subject} and the \texttt{object}, with \texttt{predicate} indicating the type of relationship. This can be depicted as a directed graph, with \texttt{subject}s and \texttt{object}s being vertices, and \texttt{predicate}s being edge labels. For example the RDF graph \{\texttt{(sky, colour, blue), (sky, above, grass), (sky, above, trees), (grass, colour, green), (trees, colour, green)}\} could be depicted as below.
